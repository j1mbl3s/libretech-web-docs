    I am not affiliated with Libre Computer.
    I just like their stuff and think that more people should, too.

    I am not responsible for your inability to read,
    follow directions,
    do your own research,
    or for any damage you may cause to your devices or data.

    The Internet has an abundance of information
    (the quality of which _can_ be questionable;
    you need to figure out which sources are credible;
    question everything that don't sound right)
    and the means to find it.
