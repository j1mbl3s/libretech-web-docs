       you need to figure out which sources are credible;
       question everything that don't sound right :smirk:

??? question ""What is your affiliation to Libre Computer?""

    **I am _not_ affiliated with Libre Computer.**

    I like the boards that I have _purchased_ for what they are.

    After reading online discussions and reviews,
    I thought that people would appreciate having
    a more direct and user-friendly option to the
    [Community Hub][Libre Computer Community]
    site as documentation.

    Creating this site was a result of wanting to
    help others,
    document my personal journey with my boards,
    and try out a different tool for generating static sites.

    I welcome you to contribute
    [on GitHub][libretech-web-docs repository].
